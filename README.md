# aws-sandbox
Examples, PoCs, and experiements in my sandbox AWS environment.

## Note
Each subdirectory is it's own project.  Terraform should be run at the subdirectory level.  Each subdirectory or project should have it's own README.md.  Maybe I'll create some automation to update this file with references to those when a new one is added.
